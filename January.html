    <h1>Girl, Interrupted</h1>
    <h2>by Susanna Kaysen</h2>
    <p>In 1967, after a session with a psychiatrist she'd never seen before, eighteen-year-old Susanna Kaysen was put in
        a taxi and sent to McLean Hospital. She spent most of the next two years on the ward for teenage girls in a
        psychiatric hospital as renowned for its famous clientele--Sylvia Plath, Robert Lowell, James Taylor, and Ray
        Charles--as for its progressive methods of treating those who could afford its sanctuary.</p>

    <p>Kaysen's memoir encompasses horror and razor-edged perception while providing vivid portraits of her fellow
        patients and their keepers. It is a brilliant evocation of a "parallel universe" set within the
        kaleidoscopically shifting landscape of the late sixties. Girl, Interrupted is a clear-sighted, unflinching
        documnet that gives lasting and specific dimension to our definitions of sane and insane, mental illness and
        recovery.</p>
